# Customising the Windows command prompt

I have a fairly extensive command prompt setup.

## AutoRun
The first thing you need to know when customising your command prompt is to get your custom script to run everytime
you start a new command prompt. This is achieved by setting up the AutoRun entry in the registry:

`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Command Processor\AutoRun="%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\cmdstartup.bat"`

## Aliases
Next I find it useful to setup some aliases or macros as they are called in Windows.

## Prompt
