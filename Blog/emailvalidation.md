# Email validation and the `+` character

Why do so many websites not allow you to use the `+` character in your email
address?

For those of you who don't know, many email servers allow the use of a `+` in
your email address. Everything between the `+` and `@` is ignored. For example,
if your email address is `joe@gmail.com`, then you can use `joe+spam@gmail.com`
and it will still reach your inbox. I find this feature very useful to
determine where spam has come from.

It is very annoying when I'm trying to create an account on a website on the
email validation fails if I try to use this feature.
