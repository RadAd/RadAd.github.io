# iPad file system

The biggest annoyance when using the iPad is its lack of a shared file system. Due to this limitation it makes it very
difficult to manage files across various apps. This design promotes an app centric viewpoint rather than a document centric
viewpoint and reverses the major innovation that Windows 95 introduced us to.

This is the reason why every app includes its own PDF viewer preventing me from using my favourite one. This is the reason
why I cant use my favourite text editor to edit a file in my dropbox. The design requires each app to include all features
you might possibly need rather than focus on a single function. For most of your toy web based apps this isn't really a
concern, and is probably why the platform has prospered, but to be considered a decent computing platform it needs a shared
file system.

Recently I wanted to try a movie file in various iOS players to see which was the best, but due to the onerous task of
having to copy the file to each app I had no choice but to give up. The access to the apps files via iTunes is the most
insane example of user interface design I have ever come across. I generally try to stay away from iTunes anyway but this
section is particularly annoying to use. I would like to try out some of the alternatives but they all seem to require
iTunes to be installed but I cannot bring myself to do that to my computer.
