# Visual Bookmarks

I have been using google bookmarks for a while now. I mostly like it, my only real problem is that it isn't very nice to
look at. I wish it would at least use fav icons. This got me looking into bookmark alternatives and more specifically visual
bookmarks. A lot of sites offer screen captures of websites to enable selecting a bookmark easier. Personally I prefer icons
as the screen captures tend to be too small.

I think I have settled on [symbaloo](http://www.symbaloo.com/). I like the grid setup although I wish I could remove the widget in the centre. It
also has a nice Android app except that it uses its own browser.
